description: Genes are specific sequences of bases that encode instructions on how
  to make proteins. It?s the proteins that perform most life functions and even make
  up the majority of cellular structures. Proteins are large, complex molecules made
  up of smaller subunits called amino acids. (Illustration courtesy of the Human Genome
