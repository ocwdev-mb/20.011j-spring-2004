### *PCR simulator*

pcr\_sim.m ([M](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-011j-statistical-thermodynamics-of-biomolecular-systems-be-011j-spring-2004/simulations/pcr_sim.m))  
Replicate a certain number of starting copies of DNA for several cycles. Try different probabilities of replication to get different histograms showing how much DNA is produced over many trials.

pcr\_sim.fig ([FIG](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-011j-statistical-thermodynamics-of-biomolecular-systems-be-011j-spring-2004/simulations/pcr_sim.fig))  
Put this in the same directory as pcr\_sim.m to be able to run "pcr\_sim" from the matlab prompt.

Random Walk - 2D with 2 Particles ([M](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-011j-statistical-thermodynamics-of-biomolecular-systems-be-011j-spring-2004/simulations/rand2d2part.m))  
Look at how these simulations work and try making your own 3D random walk or have your particle trace out a trajectory in Matlab.
